MySQL Gadgets

Tools to help make life easier with MySQL.

Note that you need to have some version of the mysql client, it's up to you to
install it.  

All gadgets take mysql command like options (-u,-p,-h,-P, -S), run with --help to
see all options.

Gadgets:

- myq_status:
        Various views based on SHOW STATUS.  Check
        http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/server-status-variables.html
        for details on what these numbers mean.

        Views:
        'myisam' - myisam specific stats, including key buffer, lock waits
        'commands' - Counts all 'Com_*' and outputs all commands run during
            each interval sorted descending by number of occurances.  This
            should be a good indication if something is running that you are
            not aware of.
        'qcache' - Info on query cache usage.
        'cttf' - Connections, Threads, Tables, Files info.
        'throughput' - Byes received/sent
        'query' - useful for query tuning:  Shows the Select_* and Sort_*
            metrics.  Refer to the mysql doc above for info on how to
            interpret.
        'temp' - Temporary table info.  
        'handler' -- Table handler stats.  Good supplemental information to
            use with the 'query' view above.a

        Innodb views are based on the SHOW STATUS variables in 5.0 and up.
        For earlier MySQL versions use 'myq_innodb_status'.
        'innodb' - an innodb summary view that tries to give an overall
            picture of the more important things happening in innodb.  
        'innodb_buffer_pool' -- all status variables regarding the innodb
            buffer pool.
        'innodb_io' -- All things reading and writing, including buffer
            pool,'pages', 'data', and 'dblwr'.
        'innodb_log' -- all transaction log related status.  'Innodb_log*' and
            'Innodb_os_log*'.
        'innodb_row' -- 'Innodb_row_lock*'.


- myq_innodb_status:  
        like iostat for innodb, connects to mysql and parses the output of SHOW 
        INNODB STATUS at intervals (defaults 60 secs).  Calculates changes for 
        counter type variables. Tested with 4.1, works with 5.x but probably
        isn't as detailed as the innodb views in  myq_status.  

        Note that the data from this script is exclusively from SHOW INNODB
        STATUS, and the meaning of many metrics are not clear.  Consult the
        MySQL Manual for all the available information on them.

- myq_slave_info:  
        Connects to the host given and checks SHOW SLAVE STATUS.  Connects to 
        the master host (using the same username and password as the slave) and 
        does SHOW MASTER STATUS.  Compares the binary log positions and reports the 
        how far behind the IO and SQL threads are.  Also reports replication
        delay.  


Standard Options:

-u: mysql username 
-p: mysql password (leave blank to be prompted)
-S: mysql socket
-h: hostname of the mysql server
-H: file with a list of hosts to use (instead of -h).  
-P: port to connect to (default: 3306)
-r: repeat execution of the script (sometimes assumed by the script)
-t: repeat after this many seconds



NOTE: Further releases will have more tools.
